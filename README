Commands:

load_db: Renews database and runs a migration

TODO
load_dummy: Will eventually load dummy data (users, interests, matches, conversations etc) once we have scripts to populate the db

start: Starts the server with the command python manage.py runserver - Better than foreman start as far as I can tell because it's a native Django command
