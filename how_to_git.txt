IMPORTANT NOTES
--DO NOT commit files in BIN folders
--DO NOT do any work on a local master branch - ALWAYS BRANCH
--DO NOT do any work until you "git pull origin master" FIRST
--DO NOT push to global master until pulling those changes into your local repository using "git merge origin master" and testing thoroughly
--DO NOT use "git add" to add entire folders of files: be sure of every single file you're committing

--DO use git merge to combine another branch into your current working local branch
